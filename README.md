# H3 Eros Max (picture to video with sound) — RunPod Serverless worker

> 🔞 **Adult (18+) · NSFW** — part of afterdark-workers, workers for uncensored adult image and video models.

A ready-to-build [RunPod Serverless](https://runpod.io?ref=qpguwapm) worker for **[H3 Eros Max — beta7](https://civitai.com/models/2851079?modelVersionId=3429412)** by [tenstrip](https://civitai.com/user/tenstrip), an adult MiniMax H3 merge that makes video with its own sound (voice, effects, music) from your picture (8 steps). Based on the official [`runpod/worker-comfyui`](https://github.com/runpod-workers/worker-comfyui).

Models are baked into the image, so a cold start does not re-download anything.

> 18+ model. You download it with your own Civitai account and are responsible for following the model licenses ([MiniMax H3 Community License](https://huggingface.co/MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-H3/blob/main/LICENSE)).

Just the model as its creator released it — no LoRAs, no extra nodes. All files are checked by SHA-256 at build time. ComfyUI is upgraded to 0.43.1 (MiniMax H3 is built into ComfyUI from there on).

## Setup (about 10 minutes + build time)

New to this? Follow the [step-by-step setup guide](https://cobaltpear.github.io/guide.html).

1. **Make your own private copy** — click **Use this template** → **Create a new repository** → choose **Private**.
   (Your Civitai token will be in it, so it must stay private.)
2. **Add your Civitai token** — get one at civitai.com → Account settings → **Security & Apps** → **API Keys** → **Add API key** → Permission preset **Read Only**.
   In your copy, open `Dockerfile` → ✏️ edit → replace `PASTE_YOUR_CIVITAI_TOKEN_HERE` on line 6 → Commit.
   No RunPod account yet? [Sign up here](https://runpod.io?ref=qpguwapm) — a referral link: after you first add $10, RunPod gives you a bonus credit (usually $5–10) and this repo a small credit.
3. **Create the endpoint** — see [Create the endpoint](#create-the-endpoint) below.
4. **Create an API key** — RunPod → Settings → API Keys → **Restricted**, allow only this endpoint.

## Create the endpoint

RunPod → **Serverless** → **New Endpoint** → **Deploy from a GitHub repository** → pick your copy (the first time, **Edit connection** lets RunPod see it). Then, top to bottom on the page:

| Where on the page | What to set |
|---|---|
| **Endpoint name** | anything — your copy's name is fine |
| **GPU configuration** | tick every box of 48 GB or more, on both tabs **Previous generation** and **Latest generation** (more boxes = easier to get a GPU) |
| **Max workers** | `1` |
| Click **Advanced settings** to open it: | |
| → **Active workers** | `0` — nothing to pay while idle |
| → **GPU count** | `1` |
| → **Idle timeout** | `5` sec — or longer if you make several in a row (see below) |
| → **Enable FlashBoot** | on (the switch) · **Standard** |
| → **Enable execution timeout** | on · **Execution timeout** `900` sec |
| → **Minimum CUDA version** | `13.0` — this worker uses PyTorch for CUDA 13 (the creator's recommended sparse attention needs it). With `RECOMMENDED=0` (below), leave it as it is |
| → click **Container configuration** to open it → **Container disk** | 80 GB |

Leave everything else as it is, then **Deploy** at the bottom. The first build takes a while (it downloads about 45 GB).

**This build runs close to RunPod's 30-minute build limit.** How long it takes depends on RunPod's network that day. If the build stops with a time-out, nothing is wrong with your copy — build it again: in your copy, edit `README.md` (✏️), add any line, and commit. RunPod starts a new build by itself.

Still timing out after two tries? In your `Dockerfile`, change `ARG RECOMMENDED=1` to `ARG RECOMMENDED=0` and commit. That build skips the creator's sparse attention: it builds faster and runs on any machine, and videos take longer. Then also set **Minimum CUDA version** back to what it was (`12.0`).
<!-- cp:initializing first=request -->
The very first request after that waits while a worker pulls the image — this can take a long time. The worker shows **Initializing**. To see what it's doing: endpoint page → **Workers** → click the worker → **Logs** → **System**.

- No error → leave it. A big image can sit on one line for a long time. Lines starting with `INFO` are normal.
- The same error keeps repeating → delete that worker with the 🗑 icon at the right end of its row. RunPod starts a new one.
- Still failing after that → ask us in [Discussions](https://github.com/afterdark-workers/afterdark-workers.github.io/discussions) with a screenshot of the log, or the whole log.
<!-- /cp:initializing -->

**Making several in a row?**

<!-- cp:several result=result -->
RunPod turns the worker off 5 seconds after each result (**Idle timeout** `5` sec). The next request then waits while a worker starts and loads the model again. It may be the same machine or a different one, so this wait can be short or long.

If you look at a result and send the next one soon after, set **Idle timeout** higher, for example `300` sec (endpoint page → **Manage** → **Edit Endpoint** → **Advanced settings**). The worker then stays on for that long after each result, and the next one starts right away. You pay for that time too, so set it back to `5` when you're done.

In short: `5` sec means you wait at each start and pay nothing while idle. Longer means no wait, and you pay while it waits for you.
<!-- /cp:several -->

## Or run it on Modal

The same worker also runs on [Modal](https://modal.com) — another serverless GPU service, billed by the second — from `modal_app.py` in this repo. It builds the same `Dockerfile` and answers the same requests as on RunPod (`/run`, `/status/<id>`), so a client that calls RunPod endpoints needs only the other address and key. If the worker doesn't start there with `RECOMMENDED=1`, use `RECOMMENDED=0`.

On your computer, with Python 3.10 or newer, in a copy of your repo (`git clone` it, with your `Dockerfile` lines filled in):

```sh
pip install modal
modal setup                                                   # opens a page to sign in to Modal
modal secret create cobaltpear-key CP_KEY=<a long password you make up>
modal deploy modal_app.py                                     # builds, then prints the worker's address
```

- The address ending in `-api….modal.run` is your endpoint; send `Authorization: Bearer <that password>` with each request.
- GPU: the `GPU` line at the top of `modal_app.py` (48 GB by default). A worker turns off 60 s after its last picture.
- Modal needs a payment method on your account to use GPUs. Its prices: [modal.com/pricing](https://modal.com/pricing).
- Updates: run `modal deploy modal_app.py` again.

## Updates

Your copy only holds the token. The build steps (`build.sh`, `handler.py`) are downloaded from this repo on every build, so when something changes upstream (a model file is replaced, ComfyUI needs an update) it is fixed here — you just rebuild your endpoint.

To rebuild: commit any change to the `main` branch of your copy — RunPod builds again on every push to `main` (the endpoint's **Builds** tab shows it). Nothing to change? Edit `README.md` (✏️), add a line, **Commit changes…** → **Commit changes**.

### Model version

This repo always follows the version the model's creator currently recommends. Now: **beta7, Civitai version 3429412 (int8)**.
Each change of the build files is kept as a release (`files-…`). To stay on one, replace `latest/download` with `download/files-…` (that release's name) in both `ADD` lines of your `Dockerfile`.

## Use it

Any client that sends ComfyUI API-format workflows to RunPod works. `pack.json` in this repo holds the workflow and tells a client where the prompt, seed and size go (format `pack/1`, engine `comfyui`).

Raw request:

```bash
IMG=$(base64 -w0 photo.png)
curl -X POST https://api.runpod.ai/v2/<ENDPOINT_ID>/runsync \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"input\": {\"workflow\": $(jq .workflow pack.json | jq '.["6"].inputs.string_b = "She turns her head and smiles. Soft room tone, a quiet laugh." | .["15"].inputs.noise_seed = 1'), \"images\": [{\"name\": \"start_image.png\", \"image\": \"$IMG\"}]}}"
```

Your picture goes in `images` under the name `start_image.png` — the workflow's LoadImage node reads it from there.

The video (MP4 with sound) comes back as base64 in `output.images[0].data`.

Tips: Starts from your picture: 5 s at 24 fps with sound, 8 steps. Describe the motion and the sound, not the picture. The worker puts one line in front of your prompt that tells H3 to start from your picture. It runs with the creator's settings for beta7: shift 12/3 and 90% sparse attention from the first step.

### LoRAs

- **Per picture:** send up to 4 LoRAs with a request: `input.remote_loras` = `[{"name": "remote_<id>.safetensors", "url": "<download link>", "sha256": "<file sha256>"}]` plus a `LoraLoader` reading that name in the workflow — the worker downloads each once and keeps it while it runs. [Cobalt Pear](https://cobaltpear.github.io/) does all of this from a Civitai or Hugging Face link. For more than 4, set the environment variable `REMOTE_LORA_MAX` (e.g. `8`) on your endpoint (**Manage → Edit Endpoint → Environment Variables**).
- **Built in:** put links in the `LORAS` line of your `Dockerfile` — each followed by its strength — and rebuild. They are downloaded once at build time, so a fresh worker doesn't download them again. A request picks which ones it uses with `input.baked_loras` = `[{"link": "<link from LORAS>", "strength": 0.8}]` (`[]` = none); without it every one is used at its `LORAS` strength. One that isn't built in (yet) is left out and named in `output.warning`, and `output.built_in` lists the built-in LoRAs. Put their trigger words in your prompt yourself. To accept only built-in LoRAs, set `REMOTE_LORA_MAX` to `0`.
<!-- cp:video-loras -->
- **Video model:** the worker is big, so its build is already long. Built-in LoRAs add to it, and RunPod stops a build after 30 minutes — so for this model, send LoRAs with each request (**By link** in Cobalt Pear).
<!-- /cp:video-loras -->
- Pick LoRAs made for this model's base model — the worker warns (`output.warning`) when one doesn't fit.
